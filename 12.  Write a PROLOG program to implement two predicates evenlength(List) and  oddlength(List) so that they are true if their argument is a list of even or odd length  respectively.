# Prolog
% evenlength(List) :- true if List has an even number of elements.
% oddlength(List)  :- true if List has an odd number of elements.

% Base case: The empty list has even length.
evenlength([]).

% Recursive case:
% A list has even length if removing two elements leaves another even list.
evenlength([_, _|T]) :-
    evenlength(T).

% A list has odd length if removing one element leaves a list of even length.
oddlength([_|T]) :-
    evenlength(T).
